# Prioritise (working title)

## What is it?

Do you have clients that like to change their mind over feature priority during development of their website or whatever? This tool is for. Here's how it works.

## How it works

1. Create a list of the features you and your client have identified for their new website or whatever.
2. Give them a link to the list (behind a password you define for them).
3. Leave them to reorder the features from highest to lowest priority.
4. When they're done you lock the list, and get them to sign-off on that priority list.

## That's it?

That's it.

## But why?

Well we've all been there. The client needs you to urgently redirect development resources to Pinterest integration because "I don't know we saw it on the news and if we're on Pinterest then we'll get more visitors".

That's when you bring up the list and say "well it's not a priority according to this list we agreed on, so let's not do that".

## What if my client kicks up a fuss?

I can't help you there. Maybe 37signals make something for that.

## Installation

You'll need Node.js with npm, Grunt, Sass, Nodemon etc etc. Just basically keep trying to run npm until it stops arguing with you.

Once you've got everything with npm, try running `grunt`. That should prepare any front-end scripts that need to be compiled, and start a Node server at localhost:3000
